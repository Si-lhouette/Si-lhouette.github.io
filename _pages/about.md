I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Robotics at [FASTLab](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/fei-gao/), Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Fei Gao. I am also a visiting student scholar at [Hybrid Robotics Group](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/index.html), UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. Koushil Sreenath. Additionally, I have a one-year internship in the Planning and Control Group at [DJI](https://www.dji.com/). Before that, I received my Bachelor's Degree at Control Sciense College, Zhejiang University, and concurrently being a menber in ACEE (Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education) at Chu Kochen Honors College. 

My primary interest of research lie in Motion Planning, Multi-agent System, Reinforcement Learning. With a strong enthusiasm for exploring various aspects of robotics, I have conducted research on multiple robotic platforms, including quadrotors, wheeled robots, humanoid robots, quadrupedal robots, and flapping-wing robots.
